## Teen Marketing Classification Using K-Means Clustering
 This repository contains the prediction which was driven out using K-Means Clustering

#Problem Statement 
The many millions of teenage consumers using social networking sites have attracted the attention of marketers struggling to find an edge in an increasingly competitive market. One way to gain this edge is to identify segments of teenagers who share similar tastes, so that clients can avoid targeting advertisements to teens with no interest in the product being sold. 
Build K-means clustering model to classify the interest of teenagers by using various attributes. 

Data Description 
The SNS dataset contains 30000 observations (rows) each represents a high school student and 40 features (columns) that provides information for the student. 
1 - Gradyear: Graduation year of the student (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009) 
2 - Gender: Gender of the student (male, female) 
3 - Age: Age of the student 
4 - Friends: No of friends 
For clustering, 36 words were chosen to represent five categories of interests: namely extracurricular activities, fashion, religion, romance, and antisocial behaviour. The 36 words include terms such as football, sexy, kissed, bible, shopping, death, and drugs. The final dataset indicates, for each person, how many times each word appeared in the personâ€™s SNS profile.
